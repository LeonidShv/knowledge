    <h1>arrow functions</h1>
    <p>
        Arrow functions are special: they don't have their own this. So don't use them for object's methods.
        If we use this inside an arrow function, then its value is taken from outside
    </p>

    <p>arrow functions are anonymous</p>
    <p>don't use call, aply, bind</p>

    <pre>
        const a = {b: 1};

        let arrow = () => {
            console.log(this.b)
        }

        arrow.call(a); // undefined
    </pre>

    <p> Can not be used as constructors.</p>
    <p>Can not use yield, within its body.</p>
